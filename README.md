# Library App
### Add, save & browse.

For the backend purpose i used Django Framework with DRF.
As for the frontend I used Angular. Table was made using ng2-smart-table. Styling and components - Bootstrap and Angular Material.


Angular application is deployed on Firebase [at this link](https://library-app-stx.web.app/).

And the backend API can be found [here](https://library-app-stx.herokuapp.com/).
